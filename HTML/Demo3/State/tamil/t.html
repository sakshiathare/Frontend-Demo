    <p>Tamil Thai Valthu is the state anthem of Tamil Nadu. The song was written by Manonmaniam
         Sundaram Pillai, and composed by M. S. Viswanathan. Ever since the Tamil Nadu government under
          M. Karunanidhi issued an order on 23 November 1970,the official functions of the Government of Tamil Nadu,
           and those functions organised by educational institutions and public establishments, have started with this song,
            and ended with the Indian National Anthem. The song is sung daily in schools all over Tamil Nadu during the 
            assembly in the morning.</p><br>
